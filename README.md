How to connect Chord Manager to Linux OS.

You must use Chromium (or Chrome) for your browser, but first you must make sure your username is part of the "dialout" group, AND you must log out and log back in for the group change to take effect (and in some cases do a full reboot).

If you’re a Linux user and you’re not able to connect through the browser, please open a terminal and run:

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
